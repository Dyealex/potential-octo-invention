<div id="magic">This was a magic word exercise that one of the Udemy instructors used for a JavaScript example. I tried to duplicate it for another exercise later and made a fatal mistake of missing a key item. I looked at the new version that I had tried to do for literally an hour and a half before I found out WHY the dang thing would not work. Since I changed the wording of the variables, I had written the the wrong if statement(?). One of those &ldquo;O*M*G&rdquo; moments for certain.

 <!-- My "goal" was to change this to make it more fun than the orginal. The power is flashing off and on so I will have to quit for now but I will put the js in a seperate file in the morning. -->
 <!-- As far as my format and spacing, I tried to get each starting place of a different element on the far left side, then tab the next lines till it ends over. Is this OK? I like to leave one white space line between the elements as well. -->
